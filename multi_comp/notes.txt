the atexit module helped fix a problem where resources were not released during abnormal termination - done for clients

to fix problem of health bars, p1 holds p2 health bar and p2 holds p1 health bar

When you encounter the issue of the address still being in use after the server has terminated, it is typically due to a lingering socket in a TIME_WAIT state. This can happen because the operating system keeps the socket around for a short period to ensure that all data has been properly transmitted and acknowledged.
Use socket.SO_REUSEADDR ->  s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
                            s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
